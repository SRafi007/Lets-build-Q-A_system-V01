I'll help rewrite and format the README.md properly for the NQ-Open dataset version:

# Q&A System from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build a Question-Answering (Q&A) system from scratch using Python. It leverages the [Natural Questions Open (NQ-Open) dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/nq_open), providing a simplified version of the Natural Questions dataset for open-domain Q&A tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- **From-Scratch Implementation**: Learn the fundamental building blocks of Q&A systems
- **Custom Model**: Predicts answers directly from question-context pairs without relying on pre-built libraries
- **Dataset Exploration**: Uses the NQ-Open dataset, consisting of real-world questions and answers
- **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step implementation in Google Colab for hands-on experience

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Dataset**: The [NQ-Open dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/nq_open) consists of:
   - **Question**: Real-world queries submitted to Google
   - **Answer**: A short span or phrase answering the question
   - **No Context**: Unlike the full NQ dataset, NQ-Open does not include accompanying Wikipedia articles

2. **Pipeline**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and tokenize the question-answer pairs
   - **Model**: Train a neural network to predict answers from tokenized inputs
   - **Training**: Use supervised learning with appropriate loss functions
   - **Evaluation**: Measure model performance using accuracy and F1-score

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/qna-from-scratch.git
cd qna-from-scratch
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Use the Hugging Face datasets library to download and save the NQ-Open dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("google-research-datasets/nq_open")
dataset["train"].to_json("data/nq_train.json")
dataset["validation"].to_json("data/nq_dev.json")
```

## 📊 Training the Model

Run the train.py script to train the Q&A model:

```bash
python models/train.py
```

Training Parameters:
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training (default: 16)
- `--epochs`: Number of epochs (default: 10)
- `--learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 1e-4)

## 🛠 Usage

After training, use the trained model to predict answers:

```python
from models.qna_model import QAModel
from utils.preprocess import preprocess_input

# Load the trained model
model = QAModel.load("models/qna_model.pth")

# Predict an answer
question = "Who is the CEO of Google?"
answer = model.predict(question)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

## 📈 Evaluation

Evaluate the model on the validation set:

```bash
python models/evaluate.py
```

Metrics:
- Exact Match (EM): Measures the percentage of predictions that match the exact answer
- F1-Score: Balances precision and recall for partial matches
